                                                Aside from hackathons, this experience has been my first real work opportunity to apply my programming knowledge to real-world deliverables. To apply for this role, I had just under a week and a half to quickly teach myself React, Git, GitHub, Typescript, and advanced JavaScript to create an assigned interactive website. While at the time daunting, this experience made me realize just how much I enjoy learning through hands-on practice. Since then, the role has provided me with an incredible insight into the process of collaborating with others on deliverables and an overall idea of what it is to be a software engineer. Additionally, my position on the graphics team has given me the creative freedom to experiment with visual storytelling and user interactivity.</td>
